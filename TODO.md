# TODO / Discussion Points


- CSS/Styles
    - Breakpoints for small screens
    - About / Pricing screens --- need to look better. Font change?

- Malicious Users Check
    - Limit number of requests (per second and total over a few hours)

- Login/Signup
    - LOADING modal is a little abrupt, consider making login button a loader
    - Or wait a little before displaying it
    - Should we allow manual changes to address details?

- Groupable Businesses
    - Do later
    - like apps in iphone, create novel groups
